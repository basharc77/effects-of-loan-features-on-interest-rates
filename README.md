# Effects of Loan Features on Interest Rates

The data exploration and analysis in this investigation was carried out using the Prosper loan dataset.

The main findings are listed below:

1. The interest rate takes on a range of values between 0.04 and 0.42. The distribution is bi-modal with two peaks at 0.2 and 0.34 respectively.
2. Each loan is assigned a risk score. The lower the risk score, the more risky the loan is for Prosper. The interest rate has a negative relationship with the risk score. Loans with lower risk scores have high interest rates.
3. The interest rate is the lowest for boat purchases at 0.205 and the highest for loans with an undisclosed loan type at 0.275.
4. Loans that have defaulted or were charged off have an average interest of more than 0.29.
5. The interest rate also has a negative relationship with the borrower's credit score. The average interest rate for borrowers with the minimum credit score is 0.35.
6. While the relationship between the interest rate and the risk score is negative, the strength of the correlation varies for different loan types.
7. The largest proportion of completed loans have high risk scores and low interest rates. However loans that have defaulted or were charged off have moderate risk but very high interest rates.
